# Running the execution controller

## Option 1: Docker Desktop
If Docker is installed on your system, you can start the **execution-controller** with a single command. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory `{{output}}` and run the following command:
```shell
$ docker-compose up -d
```

## Option 2: Via shell script
If you prefer not to use Docker, you can run the `runner.sh` shell script instead.

To run the `runner.sh` script, first install **jq**. You can usually install it from Homebrew, a package manager for macOS:
```shell
$ brew install jq
```

If you donâ€™t have Homebrew installed, you can install it from the [official website](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/).

Once **jq** is installed, open your terminal, navigate to the directory `{{output}}`, and run the script with the following command:
```shell
$ sh runner.sh
```
